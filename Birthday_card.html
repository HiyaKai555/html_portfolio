<h1>Happy Birthday Baby!</h1>

<h2>On this fateful day of springtime celebration...</h2>

<p>
    Once upon a time, in a land where rent was too high and coffee was considered a love language, there lived a brave, wise, and slightly creaky man known as Sir Birthday. He was turning 34—a number so high it echoed when you said it aloud. Thirty-foooourrrr...
<br>
    To celebrate his 34th rotation around the sun, Lady Chaos threw a party themed “Ancient Relics and Retro Boyfriends.” Everyone had to wear cardigans and bring an item older than Sir Birthday himself (someone brought a VHS tape, and it spontaneously combusted).
<br>
    As a surprise, she baked a cake shaped like a dinosaur holding a tiny walker. The banner read:
    🎉 “Level 34 Unlocked – You Can Now Complain About Back Pain Without Shame!” 🎉
<br>
    Sir Birthday, touched by the love (and slightly winded from blowing out the candles), declared:
    "Age is just a number… until your knees start making that crunchy sound when you squat."
<br>
    They laughed, they danced to ‘90s hits he claimed were “still bangers,” and they ended the night watching a documentary that he fell asleep halfway through—because being adorable and old is exhausting.
<br>
    And so, Sir Birthday and Lady Chaos lived happily ever after—one dad joke and age-related roast at a time. 💖
<br>
    The end.
    (or as he says, "To be continued... after a nap.") 😌🎂
