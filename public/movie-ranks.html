<h2>"Big fish"  2003 ‧ Fantasy/Adventure ‧ 2h 5m</h2>

<h3><em>One of those late-night watches that makes you question your sleep schedule and your entire childhood in the best way.</em></h3>
<p>Big Fish is a film that’s like a warm hug from your childhood, but with a twist of existential dread. It’s a story about a father and son, but it’s also about the stories we tell ourselves and the ones we pass down. The father, Edward Bloom, is a master storyteller, weaving tales that are larger than life. But as his son Will grows up, he struggles to separate fact from fiction in his father's stories. It’s a beautiful exploration of memory, love, and the sometimes messy nature of family relationships.</p>
I caught this film during one of those “just one more movie” nights, and I’m glad I did. The director does an incredible job blending fiction with reality, creating a surreal yet deeply nostalgic vibe. It’s like a tall tale whispered by a father at dusk—ridiculous, whimsical, but strangely comforting. There's something magical in how it dances between fantasy and memory, leaving you wondering which parts were real... and realizing it doesn’t really matter.</p>


<h2>"Warrior" 2011 ‧ Action/Sport ‧ 2h 20m</h2>

<h3><em>First of all, Tom fucking Hardy. He doesn’t act—he devours every scene he’s in and he manifested the rage, the pain, and the vulnerability all at once.</em></h3>
<p></p>

<p>I watched this movie when I was 10. Yeah, ten. Probably way too young to be watching grown men beat the emotional hell out of each other in and out of a cage, but I was hooked. And even as a little girl, it made me want to fight—not just physically, but emotionally. I actually joined a kickboxing club because of it. Studied karate for a while too. Not to impress anyone, but because something about that raw power, that discipline, and the inner chaos spoke to me.
<br>
Warrior wasn’t just about MMA to me—it was about survival. About confronting pain when words don’t work anymore. It made me realize how much families can hurt each other even when they don’t mean to. How silence can be violent. And how sometimes, you’ve gotta fight not just your opponent, but your past, your parents, and your own damn reflection.
<br> 
Even now, years later, it sticks with me. Not just as a movie, but as a memory—of who I was, who I wanted to be, and the fire it lit inside me when I didn’t even have the words to explain why.</p>

<h2>"Chappie" 2015 ‧ Action/Sci-fi ‧ 2 hours</h2>
<img src="../assets/images/chappie.jpg" alt="Chappie" height="200">
<h3><em>This was one of those movies that messed with my head in a quiet, lingering way. Like, did I even really watch it? Or did it just upload itself directly into my brain like some rogue AI file? Even now, I’m not sure if Chappie was a movie or a feeling I once had.</em></h3>
<p>
There’s something incredibly haunting about watching a machine try to learn how to be human in a world that barely knows how to be humane. I found myself sympathizing with Chappie—this awkward, innocent, hyper-intelligent robot who just wanted to understand love, pain, fear... life. He was engineered to fight, but wired to feel. And somewhere in the chaos, it planted this quiet, simmering question in my head:
<br>
Can a machine feel emotions?
<br>
And if it can—what does that say about us?
<br>
It made me wonder where the line is between programming and personality. Between artificial intelligence and authentic experience. Chappie wasn’t just “cute robot learns to love.” It was “watch a society project its worst fears and deepest failures onto the one being who might actually be pure.”
<br>
It's weird. It’s flawed. It’s wild. But it stuck with me in a way most movies don't. Like a half-remembered dream that might’ve actually changed the way I see the world.
