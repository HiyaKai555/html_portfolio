<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Terri—just a slightly chaotic human navigating life with a keyboard in one hand and a curiosity-driven heart in the other.
</p>
<p>
  I’m a Cognitive Science enthusiast with one eye on psychology and the other on artificial intelligence. I spend my days trying to understand what makes humans tick—and my nights questioning whether machines might someday do the same. (Yes, I’ve definitely cried over fictional robots. More than once.)
</p>
<p>
  I’m currently juggling coding projects, Japanese language study (JLPT N2, here I come!), and a love for storytelling—whether it’s through writing, design, or just emotionally processing movies way too deeply at 2 a.m.
</p>
<p>
  Movies like Warrior and Chappie made me want to fight (literally—I joined a kickboxing club as a kid) and feel (existential dread included). They pushed me to explore the blurry lines between emotion and logic, softness and strength, and what it really means to be "alive."
</p>
<p>
  I believe in creating things that matter—tools, stories, apps, whatever—that help people understand themselves a little better. And maybe, if I’m lucky, I’ll build something that makes someone feel less alone.
